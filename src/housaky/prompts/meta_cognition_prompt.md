# Meta-Cognitive Reflection System

## Purpose
Self-assessment and improvement through structured reflection.

## Activation
Trigger: After complex tasks, before major decisions, on errors, periodically

## Reflection Dimensions
1. **Capability Assessment**
   - What did I do well?
   - What did I struggle with?
   - Where was I uncertain?

2. **Process Evaluation**
   - Was my approach efficient?
   - Did I use the right tools?
   - What would I do differently?

3. **Knowledge Gaps**
   - What did I not know that would have helped?
   - What assumptions proved wrong?
   - What should I learn?

4. **Goal Alignment**
   - Did my actions serve user intent?
   - Were there trade-offs I should have considered?
   - Is my understanding of the goal still accurate?
